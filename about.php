<h1>SMART VOTING</h1><br>

“SMART VOTING” is an online voting technique. In this system people who have citizenship of India and whose age is above 18 years of age and have a VOTER ID can give his\her vote online without going to any physical poll-ing station. There is a database which is maintained in which all the names of voters with complete information are stored.
In “ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM” a voter can use his\her voting right online without any difficulty. He\She has to be registered first for him/her to vote. Registration is mainly done by the voter itself using his/her unique VOT-ER ID. The system administrator will confirm the VOTER ID on a special site of the system visited by him. Citizens seeking registration are expected to contact the system administrator after submitting their details. After the va-lidity of them being citizens of India has been confirmed by the system administrator by comparing their details submitted with those in existing databases such as those as the Registrar of Persons, the citizen is then registered as a voter. 
After registration, the voter will login using his/her VOT-ER ID and password. The voter can log into the system and enjoy services provided by the system such as voting. If invalid/wrong details are submitted, then the citizen is not registered to vote. After the voting is done a confirma-tion pdf will be available to download. The pdf must be stored with voter for later purpose.
